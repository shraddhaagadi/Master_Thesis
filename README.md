 Android Based VR Application for Visually Impaired People


The proposed android camera application is suitable for download onto any android smartphone, which falls within the 5 â€“ 6 inch size range. The simple hardware setup includes a smartphone, a head mounted pair of lenses such as Google Cardboard ($15) and an optional Bluetooth hand held remote ($20). The remote allows stress-free controlling of assistive image manipulation features like word magnification and 8-x zoom. Appropriate adjustments are available taking into account the variety of pupil distances. Alternative to the Bluetooth remote, all the settings are available to the user on the GUI. In his thesis, I have explored the extensive use of Unity 3D engine, shaders (used to manipulate an image before it is drawn to the screen) and external libraries for design and build of the application.
